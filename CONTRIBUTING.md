# Developing

`npm start` will set up a server that compiles the project and hosts it on `http://localhost:8080`. Edit the consumer part in `/dev`, the library itself in `/src`.

`npm run format` will format TypeScript files.

`npm run build` is only needed for publishing: `npm run build && npm publish`.
